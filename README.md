# Weather_data_visualizer
## Project Overview

This mini project loads a local weather CSV, performs basic cleaning and aggregation, computes simple statistics, and creates clear plots (line, bar, scatter, combined). It is designed for freshers learning Python data analysis and visualization.
Primary goals:
Practice reading CSVs with Pandas
Handle missing data
Compute daily/monthly stats with NumPy & Pandas
Create and save plots with Matplotlib
Export cleaned data and images for reports

## Features

Load weather.csv and inspect data
Handle missing values using fillna (forward fill or column means)
Convert Date to datetime and extract Month
Compute mean/min/max/std for temperature
Aggregate monthly rainfall totals
Plots saved as PNG:
Daily temperature trend (line)
Monthly rainfall (bar)
Humidity vs Temperature (scatter)
Combined subplot (temperature trend + scatter)

## How to run (step-by-step)
1. Clone / copy files into a folder
Your repository folder should contain:
Weather_Data_Visualizer.py (or Jupyter notebook)
weather.csv
README.md (this file)

2. Install required packages (if not installed)
   Open terminal / command prompt and run:
